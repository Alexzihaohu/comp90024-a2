\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{\begin{abstract}A highly scalable distributed system is developed and deployed on Melbourne Research Cloud to collect and analyse big data from Twitter. The entire deployment process is handled by Ansible tasks to enable automation and scalability. All software services are built into Docker container images for painless deployment, while the containers run in a Docker Swarm for the simplicity of scaling. The most vibrant city, sports preferences of each city, and the sports enthusiasts across six cities in Australia are identified from over 10 million tweets and the data collected from AURIN, Twitter, and ESPN. The core web application, harvester, and controllers are wrapped in Django, which runs as a scalable cluster that supports parallel data collection for better performance. All data is stored in CouchDB and processed by MapReduce in batch jobs. Spark runs as a complement to CouchDB due to the limitation of custom reduce functions on partitioned CouchDB database. Three scenarios are covered at the data analysis phase, where the shows that Canberra is the most vibrant city while running, footy, and walking are the most popular sports. The top five sports enthusiasts are identified in a rank. \end{abstract}}
