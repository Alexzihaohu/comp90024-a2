\section{Conclusion}

By the time this report is composed, 44,774 users and 10,535,184 tweets have been collected and stored in CouchDB. It is proved that the parallel Twitter harvester gathers data faster than a single program. High scalability is achieved by the use of Docker Swarm, where scaling and deployment become relatively simpler tasks. Ansible enables the system to be deployed with a one-time execution of a shell script. The job control system enables the user to continue the harvesting, which is well-fitted with the highly usable scale tools in the system. 

The data were analysed using both CouchDB MapReduce and Spark RDD. The conclusions are passed to the front-end by Django and JavaScript for visualisation. The results are embodied in three scenarios. The first one is identifying the most vibrant city, and it turns out Canberra is the winner, with the youngest median age(36 years), highest income(1000 dollar per week), highest education rate, and lowest unemployment rate (5\%). The second scenario is the most popular sports. By aggregating the related sport, top 10 sports are found, which are running, footy, walking, racing, and football, etc. The last scenario is the sport enthusiasts rank, with top 5 body builders are picked out.
